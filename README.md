Philly Tech Week 2022 MLS Hackathon

This is our grand prize-winning submission to the PTW 2022 MLS Hackathon, where the objective was to build an approach to predict Major League Soccer(MLS) game outcomes for the current 2022 season based on supplied, aggregated data (courtesy of Sports Reference) from the previous four seasons. In addition, we used our approach to predict upcoming results for the rest of the season for MLS' Philadelphia Union.
